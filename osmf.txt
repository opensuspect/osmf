OpenSuspect Map File Specification Ver 0.1.1
By Moxvallix for OpenSuspect
Based on the png map concept by Damjan94

The OpenSuspect Map File, or OSMF, is a compressed (tar.zst) folder, containing the relevent assets for an OpenSuspect Map.
The OSMF has the file extension ".osmf".

This file is designed to be transferred over the internet, by an OpenSuspect server to an OpenSuspect client, in order to display a custom map.

As of version 0.1, this format is used for transferring map data ONLY. Game code, tasks, and sound files are not supported as of yet.
Maps are defined by a series of .png image files, which are translated by the client into a working map. Map metadata is contained in "manifest.json".
PNG is used as a format, as it is easy to modify, and visualise for novice map makers. This works towards OpenSuspect's goal of easy customisability.
(See "map_image_lookup.svg" for the colour grid)

"manifest.json" File details:
    Use: Provides metadata for the custom map, including author information, and spawn tiles.
    Layout (JSON):
        {
        "map_name": "Example Map",
        "author": "Placey the Alien",
        "contact": "placey@opensuspect.com",
        "map_version": 1,
        "osmf": 0.1,
        
        "map_layout": {
            "map_folder": "map_data",
            "spawn_tiles": [
            "#ff0000",
            "#ff2a2a",
            "#ff5555"
            ]
          }
        }
    Note: Spawn tiles are as an array of valid tiles for the map to spawn players on, based on their colour defined in the array.

"map_data" File details:
    base_tiles.png:
        Use: Tilemap for the base layer tiles.
        Dimensions: 1200x800px
        Tile Dimensions: 100x100px
        Tile Amount: 96 total (84 wall tiles and 12 floor tiles)
        Note: The image is split up into a grid of 100x100px, each cell assigned a unique colour. These colours are referenced by "base_layout.png".

    detail_tiles.png:
        Use: Tilemap for the detail layer tiles.
        Dimensions: 1200x800px
        Tile Dimensions: 100x100px
        Tile Amount: 96 total
        Note: The image is split up into a grid of 100x100px, each cell assigned a unique colour. These colours are referenced by "detail_layout.png".

    base_layout.png:
        Use: Defines the map layout for the base layer.
        Dimensions: Custom, 1 pixel per tile.
        Note: Each pixel determines the location of a tile, based on it's colour. The tile in #FF0000 for example, will appear for each pixel of #FF0000, in it's location relative to each other tile. Transparency counts as a blank tile, and is left as a blank gap in map generation.

    detail_layout.png:
        Use: Defines the map layout for the detail layer.
        Dimensions: Custom, 1 pixel per tile. (Size must match 
        Note: Each pixel determines the location of a tile, based on it's colour. The tile in #FF0000 for example, will appear for each pixel of #FF0000, in it's location relative to each other tile. Transparency counts as a blank tile, and is left as a blank gap in map generation.
