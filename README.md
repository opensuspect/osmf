# OpenSuspect Map Research
The repository dedicated to the research, and implementation, of network loaded maps for OpenSuspect.
This repository aims to eventually decide on a standard for OpenSuspect to load maps from servers, whether from the game server, or from a central repository.

As well as sending maps over the network, eventually one of these standards should support other gameplay elements, such as tasks, items, sounds and game code.
When designing the standards, we must keep in mind that the standard should be able to support such things in the future.

The first OSMF standard is Ver 0.1 by Moxvallix, which is based on the .png map creation idea by Damjan.
